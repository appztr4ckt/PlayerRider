# Language settings
########################################################################################################

# You can use Minecraft colors code in all those language parameters.
# As I've followed the essentials code notation in the plugin, you have to use the « & » symbol.
# Here is the codes you can use: https://wiki.ess3.net/mc/
#
# Usable placeholders:
# - {prefix} for the message prefix
# - {player} for the player who rides
# - {duck} for the player being riden
#
# Prefix used to all plugin messages (at least by default...)
# If you want a different prefix for messages (or no prefix), leave it blank « "" ».
# This value replace « {prefix} » in the next parameters.
prefix: "&8[&7&lPlayerRider&8] "
# Message displayed when using the command /prider-reload
reload: "{prefix}&aConfiguration successfully reloaded."
# Error message when the chosen sound « boost_whip_sound » is incorrect.
sndErr: "{prefix}&cChosen sound is invalid and has been disabled."
# Message sent to player trying to ride a player who already have reached his limit.
tooMany: "{prefix}&6{duck}&c cannot wear more players... He needs to eat more spinach!"
# Message when the player should be able to ride but it's fail (maybe another plugin cancel the event)
failed: "{prefix}&cUnable to ride &6{duck}&c, maybe another plugin is preventing it..."
# Error message when the plugin can't write to the file storing user preferences (ridability only for now)
fileErr: "{prefix}&cUnable to write to usersPreferences.yml"
# Warning message displayed in console if you try to run /prider-toggle from it
toggleWarn: "{prefix}&6Sorry console, you're not a player... Nobody can ride you!"
# Error message when the user preferences (ridability only for now) cannot be saved (file not writable)
toggleErr: "{prefix}&cUnable to toggle your ridability, contact an admin..."
# Messages sent to the player when using command /prider-toggle

statusOff: "{prefix}&aOther players cannot ride you anymore"
# Error message when you use a potion effect with wrong parameters
effectErr: "{prefix}&cError with potion effect {type}"

# In the both 3 sections: (broadcast, player and duck)
# - sub-section "ride" is used when a player riders another
# - sub-section "whip" is used when a player whips another
# - sub-section "eject" when he's being ejected
#
# If you don't want one of those messages, simply leave it blank « "" ».
# You can also adjust the cooldown for messages, see below.
broadcast:
  ride: "&f&l•&r {prefix}&6{player}&3 now rides &6{duck}&3!"

# When an action cannot be done because of the cooldown, the player will receive this message
# Because the chat can be spammed or not read, this will be done as an action bar message.
# Here, you can use {delay} as the delay value in seconds before the player will be able again.

# Disclaimer for those potion effects:
# It can be used by players to cure a higher effect, and I will not make a complex mechanic to prevent it.
# BUT, if a player has other types of effects before being mounted, those ones will not be affected by PlayerRider.
# It will only clear types of effect it had when the action begin when it stops.
#
# For example: (considering the default value of this config file with enabled = true)
# If a player is affected by a HUNGER effect for 2 minutes and is quickly mounted by another player,
# even if it's only for 1 second, he will be cured from HUNGER when this other player leaves his shoulder.
#
# So now you are warned about that, choose the effect you want to give with this in mind.

# Suggested by Elguerrero: If enabled when a player has someone on his shoulder, he will be slow down

  # Available types here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html
  # BEWARE: You have to verify for each effect you set if it can support the "max" multiplier value.
  # I cannot garantee all effect will works with all values, so make your tests before.
  # The effect showed here are arbitrary examples (I've tested those values but not using them on my server)

      max: 2     # (integer) Max value for the multiplier
      duration: 1200 # (integer, ticks : 1 sec = 20 ticks) /!\ Refreshed when the ridden player moves
