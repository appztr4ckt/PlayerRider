# Language settings
########################################################################################################
#
# You can use Minecraft colors code in all those language parameters.
# As I've followed the essentials code notation in the plugin, you have to use the « & » symbol.
# Here is the codes you can use: https://wiki.ess3.net/mc/
#
# Usable placeholders:
# - {prefix} for the message prefix
# - {player} for the player who rides
# - {duck} for the player being riden
#
# Prefix used to all plugin messages (at least by default...)
# If you want a different prefix for messages (or no prefix), leave it blank « "" ».
# This value replace « {prefix} » in the next parameters.
prefix: "&8[&7&lPlayerRider&8] "
# Message displayed when using the command /prider-reload
reload: "{prefix}&aConfiguration successfully reloaded."
# Error message when the chosen sound « boost_whip_sound » is incorrect.
sndErr: "{prefix}&cChosen sound is invalid and has been disabled."
# Message sent to player trying to ride a player who already have reached his limit.
tooMany: "{prefix}&6{duck}&c cannot wear more players... He needs to eat more spinach!"
# Message when the player should be able to ride but it's fail (maybe another plugin cancel the event)
failed: "{prefix}&cUnable to ride &6{duck}&c, maybe another plugin is preventing it..."
# Error message when the plugin can't write to the file storing user preferences (ridability only for now)
fileErr: "{prefix}&cUnable to write to usersPreferences.yml"
# Warning message displayed in console if you try to run /prider-toggle from it
toggleWarn: "{prefix}&6Sorry console, you're not a player... Nobody can ride you!"
# Error message when the user preferences (ridability only for now) cannot be saved (file not writable)
toggleErr: "{prefix}&cUnable to toggle your ridability, contact an admin..."
# Messages sent to the player when using command /prider-toggle
statusOn: "{prefix}&aOther players can now ride you"
statusOff: "{prefix}&aOther players cannot ride you anymore"

# In the both 3 sections: (broadcast, player and duck)
# - sub-section "ride" is used when a player riders another
# - sub-section "whip" is used when a player whips another
# - sub-section "eject" when he's being ejected
#
# If you don't want one of those messages, simply leave it blank « "" ».
# You can also adjust the cooldown for messages, see below.
broadcast:
  ride: "&f&l•&r {prefix}&6{player}&3 now rides &6{duck}&3!"
  whip: "&f&l•&r {prefix}&6{player}&3 whips &6{duck}&3!"
  eject: "&f&l•&r {prefix}&6{duck}&3 has ejected &6{player}&3!"

player:
  ride: "{prefix}&bYou are riding &e&l{duck}&b, yeah!!!"
  whip: "{prefix}&bYou whiped &e&l{duck}&b!!!"
  eject: "{prefix}&e&l{duck}&b's got a temper, try to give him a carrot maybe?"

duck:
  ride: "{prefix}&e&l{player}&b likes you so much, he now stands on your shoulder :)"
  whip: "{prefix}&e&l{player}&b whipped you, do you like that?"
  eject: "{prefix}&bYou've just ejected &e&l{player}&b, beware... I'm sure he will try again!"

# Cooldowns (in seconds)
cooldowns:
  ride:
    perform: 0      # Before to be able to ride again
    broadcast: 30   # Prevent spam chat: This will not display again the same message (same player, same duck)
    alertPlayer: 0  # Prevent spam chat (for the player who has just ride another)
    alertDuck: 0    # Prevent spam chat (for the player being ridden)
    
  whip:
    perform: 2      # Before to be able to whip again
    broadcast: 30   # Prevent spam chat: This will not display again the same message (same player, same duck)
    alertPlayer: 2  # Prevent spam chat (for the player who has just whip another)
    alertDuck: 2    # Prevent spam chat (for the player who has just been whipped)
    
  eject:
    perform: 3      # /!\ Not a real cooldown here, but time to wait before being able to eject the rider
    broadcast: 30   # Prevent spam chat: This will not display again the same message (same player, same duck)
    alertPlayer: 3  # Prevent spam chat (for the rider who has just been ejected)
    alertDuck: 3    # Prevent spam chat (for the player who has just ejected his rider)

# When an action cannot be done because of the cooldown, the player will receive this message
# Because the chat can be spammed or not read, this will be done as an action bar message.
# Here, you can use {delay} as the delay value in seconds before the player will be able again.
#
# If you don't want one of those messages, simply leave it blank « "" ».
warn_player_when_cooldown:
  ride: "&4&lWait &6&l{delay}&4&ls before to ride another player"
  whip: "&4&lWait &6&l{delay}&4&ls before to whip again &e&l{duck}"
  eject: "&4&lWait &6&l{delay}&4&ls before to eject &e&l{duck}"

# Settings which change the plugin mechanisms

# Here, you will define which items the player can have in hand to perform the action.
# You can find usable names here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
allowed_items:
  ride: # Action: Ride a player

  ride: false
  whip: true

# Define how many riders can sit on the same player's shoulders
# You can set groups you need, and give the appropriate permission to your users.
# Each groups you define will be checked with the permission "playerrider.duck.<group>"
max_riders:
  # This group is the default one (if you delete it, it will be re-added into your configuration).
  # It will be applied to all players who don't have another "playerrider.duck.<group>" permission.
  # No need to give the permission "playerrider.duck.newbies", it's assumed if the player have "playerrider.duck".
  default: 16
  # Here are some examples to illustrate:
  # newbies: 1    <--- corresponds to the permission "playerrider.duck.newbies"
  # staff: 32     <--- corresponds to the permission "playerrider.duck.staff"

# Max pitch value the riden player must be to be able to eject his rider
# (look with F3 in the game and see what pich value is OK for you).
eject_maxPitch: -40.0
# Decide if a player riden should automaticaly eject his rider when taking damages (true or false)
eject_when_hurt: true
# Same, but for the rider: If he takes damages, he's get off the player or not (true or false).
getoff_when_hurt: true
# Decide if riders will be protected of suffocation damages when riding a player (true or false).
prevent_suffocation: true

##### [ the next parameters are ignored if boost_allowed: false ] #####

# Value of the speed boost (integer), 0 to disable the boost
boost_amplifier: 4
# Duration in server ticks (20 ticks = 1 second) of the speed effect, 0 to disable the boost
boost_duration: 60
# Max pitch value the rider must be to whip and boost the player (float), check in game with F3.

# Sound the whip action will play, see https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Effect.html

boost_whip_pitch: 1.3
# Tips: To find the sound you want, you can use the ingame /playsound command.

##### New in version 1.14 #####

# Max pitch value the riden player must be to be able to view his rider
# (look with F3 in the game and see what pich value is OK for you).
# If not used, the player view can be obstructed by rider legs...
hide_rider_maxPitch: 25 # 0 to disable this feature
# Please note: This is not perfect, because if the player use third person view, it has no sense...
# and unfortunately, this cannot be detected in a Spigot plugin (this is client side)
